In this lab you will be creating a basic Express app.

1). You will need to create a project folder and create inside that folder a .js file named app.js. When you turn this lab in you will need to zip the project folder with all the files and folders of your project in that project folder.

2). Create a node js project with a package.json file. The name of your app project in the .json file should be zookeeper

3). Add express.js to your project 

4). Setup the app.js file to use express, have a server/host location of 3000 (if you need to use another localhost port, you will need to include the different port in the comment line when you submit.

5). The 'home' page content will include an <h1> for ZooKeeper and you will need to add in the send an <h3> of Keeping Track of All Our Critters, and a <p> giving a brief 1-2 paragraph on the apps purpose (your choice as long as it relates to zoo or people who look after zoos.

6). Make sure you test using localhost that this is showing your 'home' content!

7). Add a 'page' (/about) with the <h1> of About Us, and a short <p> (your content--1-2 paragraphs) about a fictional Zoo Keeper/Zoo organization.

8). Add another 'page' (/favorites) with an <h1> of Zoo Favorites and add a ul list with 10 items showing the current favorite animals in zoos.

Bonus: +5 points

Add a page (/survey) with an <h1>Favorite Zoo Animal Survey</h1> and create a form (as in the practice example) with /results, POST, name (fav_vote) and have a text input with a button submit. Then use (/results) route to 'catch' the the inputted value in a console log. Don't forget to add the urlencoded to be able to see the input as text in the console message (step 10-12 in the practice)
